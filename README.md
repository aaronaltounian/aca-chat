# ACA Chat

# Windows users - Make sure you remove single quotes from the package.json

# Setup
* Fork and clone, npm install, npm start
* Look at server/index.js and understand what is going on in there
* Look at client/src/components/Chat.js and understand what is going on in there



# Todo
* This will start a web server and my custom data server (server/index.js)
* Open 2 browsers windows to http://myipaddress:3101/
* Send a message from one window and then refresh the other window the message shows up
* You try this by going to http://myipaddress:3101/
* Look at the console, there is an error. Why? Look at actions/index.js
* I do not want to have to refresh the page every time I want to see new messages. I want the new messages to just show up automatically. How can we accomplish this.
* How many clients could I open up and chat with?
* What happens to the messages when the server is restarted? How could we fix this?
* How could I design the system to have chat rooms?
* Try implementing voice recognition for the chat messages
